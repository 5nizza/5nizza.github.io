<p>The original source is: <a href="http://pub.ist.ac.at/gametheory/Lecture4.pdf">http://pub.ist.ac.at/gametheory/Lecture4.pdf</a></p>
<p><span style="font-size:1rem;line-height:1.714285714;">I found the proof on the page 5 somewhat unclear, so give here my understanding of it, and also give smaller (but more difficult to remember), formula and proof for the winning set in Buechi games.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Original Formula</h2>
<p>The original formula for a winning set in Buechi game is:</p>
<p>$latex Y = \nu Y \mu X. [(B \cap Pre_1(Y)) \cup (\neg B \cap Pre_1(X))]$</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">The idea of the proof is to show that in the winning region $latex Y^*$ the first player: a) can always enforce the game to visit a state in $latex B$; b) after visiting state in $latex B$ the first player can again reach the winning set $latex Y^*$. This together means that the first player visits final states infinitely often.</span></p>
<p>Lets consider the greatest fixpoint first and fix $latex Y^*$:</p>
<p>$latex Y^* = \mu X. [(B \cap Pre_1(Y^*)) \cup (\neg B \cap Pre_1(X))]$</p>
<p>Let $latex T=B \cap Pre_1(Y^*)$, then $latex Y^* = \mu X. [T \cup (\neg B \cap Pre_1(X))]$, which reminds the winning set for reachability game, except additional $latex \neg B$. It can be shown, for example by contraction, that it is more smaller than reachability set and therefore:</p>
<p>$latex Y^* \subseteq \ll 1 \gg (\diamond (B \cap Pre_1(Y^*)))$.</p>
<p>Lets show that from any state in $latex Y^*$ the first player can again reach state in $latex Y^*$. In the original source this is proved by considering all possible cases: <span style="font-size:1rem;line-height:1;">$latex x \in T$ and $latex x \notin T$, a</span><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">nd proving that in both cases the first player can reach $latex Y^*$. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">But hey, look! Any state in $latex Y^*$ can reach $latex B \cap Pre_1(Y^*)$, and from the state in $latex Pre_1(Y^*)$ the first player can always reach $latex Y^*$. Therefore, the the statement is correct and there is no need to consider all cases as in the original source.</span></p>
<p>OK, we showed that if the first player stays in $latex Y^*$, then Buechi condition is satisfied. What about other direction?</p>
<h2>Modified Formula</h2>
<p>The reasoning above could also apply if we remove $latex \neg B$ from the formula. Therefore the formula for the winning set of Buechi game becomes:</p>
<p>$latex Y = \nu Y \mu X. [(B \cap Pre_1(Y)) \cup Pre_1(X)]$</p>
<p>Lets check the original proof and see if it works for this case. Again we remove greatest fix point operator by fixing $latex Y^*$:</p>
<p>$latex Y^* = \mu X. [(B \cap Pre_1(Y^*)) \cup Pre_1(X)]$</p>
<p>Let $latex T=B \cap Pre_1(Y^*)$, then $latex Y^* = \mu X. [T \cup Pre_1(X)]$, which is the winning set for reachability game, therefore:</p>
<p>$latex Y^* = \ll 1 \gg (\diamond (B \cap Pre_1(Y^*)))$.</p>
<p>By using the same argument as for "original formula", the first player can always reach states in $Pre_1(Y^*)$ and from there -- the state in $Y^*$. Therefore, the Buechi condition is satisfied and this modified formula represents the winning condition for Buechi game.</p>
<h2>The other direction</h2>
<p>What if the set $latex Y^*$ represents just the subset of the winning set, or even just always empty?</p>
<p>Idea only. It should be possible to prove it by contradiction. Assume there is a state $latex x$ from which there is a winning strategy for the first player. Consider the infinite path generated by this state. It contains (at least) one state in $latex B$ infinitely often. Then lets make $latex Y^* = states-of-that- path$. Such $latex Y^*$ satisfies the original formula. Contradiction. Some details are omitted and I am not sure that this way will prove the other direction but would try it first.</p>
<p>Have fun in your learning!</p>
