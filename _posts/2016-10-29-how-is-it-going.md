title: How is it going?

Last week we submitted a paper to TACAS'17.
The paper does not have much new, but I think the direction is wonderful.
The last moment I found a screaming bug in the prototype implementation --- hope to fix it before the reviewers start reading!

That week is gone, and now I am into teaching activity.
Gave a intro lecture (had to replace my prof) on Valgrind's Memcheck tool.
Refreshing that old stuff on stack/heap was fun --- I was never really tought this properly --- that was double fun!
I like lecturing when I know the topic well.

Now moved into the reviewing phase --- got one VMCAI's paper.
Haven't read it though, and only one day is left... will push myself very hard tomorrow!
Should I sign the review with the real name?
This is more honest, like looking authors into the eye.

Next will be journal paper on token passing systems.
I promised to incorporate recent proofs of my co-authors, 14 days to go.
Will try to visit Vienna to talk with guys --- that is more fun than reading alone!

And finally I hope to work with Sven on robots --- wanna try new collaboration, slightly new culture. Getting out of my shelf!

But instead of doing all these stuff, I just watched movie "Riverthief",
and read [blog](http://www.raleighcain.com/blog/) by Railegh Cain.
Moving. Fresh air. Life. Positive eye.
I still feel the air flowing through the hand out of the car window.
